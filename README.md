 Number Analyzer

A simple Python console application created as a learning project.

 About the project

This project was built to practice core Python concepts such as:
 functions
 loops (`for`, `while`)
 conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
 working with lists
 returning values from functions
 structuring a program using a `main()` function

The program asks the user to enter numbers until `0` is entered, then analyzes the collected data.

 Features

The program can:
 collect numbers entered by the user
 calculate the sum of positive numbers
 count how many numbers are even
 calculate the average value
 find the second largest number in the list

 How it works
The user enters numbers one by oneEntering `0` stops the inputThe program prints the analysis results to the console
